Please retry with the switch '--text-only' (along with --technique=BU) as this case looks like a perfect candidate (low textual content along with inability of comparison engine to detect at least one dynamic parameter). If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment')

Please retry with the switch '--text-only' (along with --technique=BU) as this case looks like a perfect candidate (low textual content along with inability of comparison engine to detect at least one dynamic parameter). If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment')

Please retry with the switch '--text-only' (along with --technique=BU) as this case looks like a perfect candidate (low textual content along with inability of comparison engine to detect at least one dynamic parameter). If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment')

[10:39:01] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment')

Please retry with the switch '--text-only' (along with --technique=BU) as this case looks like a perfect candidate (low textual content along with inability of comparison engine to detect at least one dynamic parameter). As heuristic test turned out positive you are strongly advised to continue on with the tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment')
